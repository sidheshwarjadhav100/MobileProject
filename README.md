# Shree Sai Mobile Inventory Management System

## Project Overview

The **Mobile Inventory Management System** is a console-based Java application built to manage mobile product data. It allows users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of products, making it a robust tool for inventory management. The system is built using **Core Java**, and it follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features

- **Add Products**: Add new mobile products with details like ID, company name, series, and price.
- **Display Products**: View a list of all products currently in the inventory.
- **Update Products**: Update existing product details based on the product ID.
- **Delete Products**: Remove products from the inventory by specifying their ID.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and exceptions, ensuring smooth operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary language used to implement the core functionality of the system.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Encapsulation for the `Product` class, ensuring data protection.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separate layers for Controller, Service, and Data Access (DAO) to organize the logic and ensure easy maintenance.
- **Console Interface**: Simple command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the application.
